# Machine Learning Recommendation Systems in Python

This repository contains several machine learning recommendation system projects implemented in Python. These projects demonstrate different approaches to building recommendation systems, each tailored to solve specific problems or optimize recommendations in various domains.

## Projects

### 1. **Top Restaurants Recommendation System**
   - **Dataset**: Yelp Restaurant Reviews
   - **Objective**: To recommend top restaurants to users based on their reviews and ratings.
   - **Description**: This project uses the Yelp dataset to build a recommendation system that suggests the best restaurants to users. The system analyzes user reviews and ratings to provide personalized recommendations.

### 2. **Music Recommendation Systems**
   - **Objective**: To recommend music tracks to users based on different recommendation strategies.
   - **Description**: This project explores various methods to build music recommendation systems. The approaches include:

   - **a. Rank-Based Recommendation System**: 
     - **Use Case**: Useful for cold start problems when a new user enters the system without historical data.
     - **Method**: Recommends the most popular items, making it a robust solution when there is no user-specific data available.

   - **b. Collaborative Filtering Based on User-Item Interactions**:
     - **Method**: Does not require detailed information about users or items. Instead, it relies on user-item interaction data to generate recommendations.

   - **c. User-User Similarity Based Recommendation System**:
     - **Method**: Builds a baseline recommendation system by finding similarities between users to recommend items liked by similar users.

   - **d. Four Types of Recommendation Systems**:
     - **Knowledge/Rank-Based Recommendation System**: Provides recommendations based on predefined rules or popular choices.
     - **Similarity-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Uses similarity measures between users or items to generate recommendations.
     - **Matrix Factorization-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Applies matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for more sophisticated recommendations.
     - **Clustering-Based Recommendation System**: Groups users or items into clusters and provides recommendations based on the clusters.
